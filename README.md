# Restaurant_booking_app_in_python
The aim of this projects was to create a basic app, where I use interactive python.
I wanted to create a reaturant booking application. Where someone can reserve a table at a restaurant,
and also state the number of guests that they have.
I have two files, Reservation_App does not include the graphical user interface and the Reservation_1_Application is the one that create a graphical user interface.
